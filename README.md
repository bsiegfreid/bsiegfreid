The vast majority of my work lives behind corporate firewalls. Most of my work on GitHub is in private repositories as I experiment with different technologies. Sometimes I'll make something public if I think it'll be useful.

I'm always trying to find time to learn Swift. I rely on Python to quickly deliver reliable solutions, even if it costs some performance at runtime. Java is a reliable workhorse that is often a solid choice.
